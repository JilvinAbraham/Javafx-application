# Javafx-application

This is a Todo Application to easily manage your daily tasks.

For the front end I have used scene builder from gluon.
The backend database is supported with Mysql database.
Logic of application is written in Java.

The application lets user sign Up (create an account).
Then with necessary credentials the user can login and add task to using their personal add task interface.
The datbase has two tables one for users and other for tasks.
The tables are connected using a foreign key which is the userid from the users table.

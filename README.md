# Javafx-application

This is a Todo Application to easily manage your daily tasks.

For the front end I have used scene builder from gluon.
The backend database is supported with Mysql database.
Logic of application is written in Java.

The application lets user sign Up (create an account).
Then with necessary credentials the user can login and add task using their personal add task interface.
The database has two tables one for users and other for tasks.
The tables are connected using a foreign key which is the userid from the users table.

To run the application you can download the folders open up the project in intellij and run the Main.java file.
For the database part you need attach the connector/J jar file foenix features download the foenix.jar file.
